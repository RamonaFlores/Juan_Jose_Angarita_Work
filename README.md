# Juan_Jose_Angarita_Work

Hey I'm Juan Jose from Colombia, and I'm a software engineering student at ICESI. I really enjoy learning new  languages and using my acquired knowledge to develop silly personal projects.
Navigating through the world of software is like a marathon, and I've got my running shoes on for the long haul!
